# BlackJackProject

# Description 

In this project I created a fully functional game of BlackJack that can be played by the user on a loop as many times as they wish.

# Technologies Used

In my code I used an ArrayList, Super Classes, inheritance, Polymorphism, if t, and while and for loops.

# Lessons Learned
While coding this project, I learned the value of understanding methods. Knowing where to call them is vital for making the program work in a cohesive and efficient manner. Also line 38-43 on my BJApp.java were my favorite lines as I was able to make it so the previous data from the previous game was always guaranteed to be cleared.
